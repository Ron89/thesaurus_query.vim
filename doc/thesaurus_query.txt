1. Intro                                                             *tq-intro*

This is a plugin for user to lookup synonyms of any word under cursor and
replace it with an user chosen synonym. It also accept word covered in visual
mode or manual input. But for the latter two cases, auto-replacement function
is not activated by default.

Multiple backends are used for this plugin, by default, three are enabled:

    *   "thesaurus_com" Online backend querys from
        [Thesaurus.com](http://thesaurus.com/) for
        synonym, so internet connection is required for this backend's
        functionality.

    *   "openoffice_en" querys from OpenOffice's thesaurus source. If
        you have OpenOffice (Not LibreOffice) installed on your Machine, the
        files should be `/usr/share/myspell/dicts/th_en_US_v2[.idx,.dat]`, and
        the backend would function properly. But if OpenOffice isn't provided
        by the distro-repo or if the thesaurus database is provided elsewhere,
        you'll need to manually indicate the database location in your system
        by setting `g:tq_openoffice_en_file`. E.g. If my database files are
        `~/Downloads/Mythes-1.0/th_en_US_new[.idx,.dat]`, my setting needs to
        be >
        let g:tq_openoffice_en_file="~/Downloads/MyThes-1.0/th_en_US_new"
<
    *   "mthesaur_txt" querys from `mthesaur.txt`. For this backend to work,
        be sure to download the file from
        [gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3202/files/) and place
        it under "~/.vim/thesaurus". If you place the file elsewhere, change
        global variable |g:tq_mthesaur_file| to point to the file you
        downloaded, eg. put the following line `let
        g:tq_mthesaur_file="~/.config/nvim/thesaurus/mthesaur.txt"` into your
        `.vimrc` file if your `mthesaur.txt` is placed in folder
        "~/.config/nvim/thesaurus/".


===============================================================================
2. Requirements                                               *tq-requirements*

Since the plugin is written in python, the vim should have +python support.
Internet is required for online query backend to be functional;
`mthesaur.txt` is required for local query backend to be functional.


===============================================================================
3. Usage                                                             *tq-usage*

The plugin provides several ways of using.

:ThesaurusQueryReplaceCurrentWord         *:ThesaurusQueryReplaceCurrentWord*
    This command checkup the word under cursor and attempt to replace it with
    use chosen candidate.

:ThesaurusQueryLookupCurrentWord           *:ThesaurusQueryLookupCurrentWord*
    This command checkup the word under cursor and list all found synonyms in
    a split buffer.

:Thesaurus                                                       *:Thesaurus*
    This routine take one argument as target word and then query its synonyms.
    Query result would be displayed in a split buffer.

:ThesaurusQueryReplace                               *:ThesaurusQueryReplace*
    DO NOT use this command directly!!!
    The command used by synonym replacing key-mapping for phrase selected in
    visual mode.

:ThesaurusQueryReset                                   *:ThesaurusQueryReset*
    Reset ThesaurusQuery, empty cached history in current session, restore
    backend priority sequence to default/user defined in
    `g:tq_enabled_backends`.

The functionalities are also mapped to key-bindings, if `g:tq_map_keys=1` as
default (Note: since this plugin is active for all buffers, the use of
`<LocalLeader>`is now depreciated):
    nnoremap <unique> <Leader>cs :ThesaurusQueryReplaceCurrentWord<CR>
    vnoremap <unique> <Leader>cs "ky:ThesaurusQueryReplace <C-r>k<CR>
    nnoremap <LocalLeader>cs :ThesaurusQueryReplaceCurrentWord<CR>
    vnoremap <LocalLeader>cs "ky:ThesaurusQueryReplace <C-r>k<CR>

4. Customization                                             *tq-Customization*

4.1 Global variables                                      *tq-global-variables*

Currently I designed several global variables used to customize the behavior.


g:tq_python_version~
    Force using the version of Python for the plugin. By default, if Python3
    support is detected, it will be used. If not, Plugin will make attempt to
    use Python2. At least one of the Python need to be supported. Argument
    value can be:
            2: use Python2
            3: use Python3 >
        let g:tq_python_version=3


g:tq_display_list_all_time~
    Determine if a minibuffer is still used when user decided to use the
    replacement routine.
            0: do not display split buffer if replace routine is used
            1: display split buffer at all time >
        let g:tq_display_list_all_time = 0
<

g:tq_map_keys~
    Decide if default keymapping is used.
            0: use default mapped keys
            1: do not use default mapped keys. >
        let g:tq_map_keys = 1
<

g:tq_use_vim_autocompletefunc~
    Decide if use Vim's built-in `comletefunc` for insert-mode synonym
    replacement. Note, `ctrl-xctrl-u` in insert mode invoke completefunc. >
        let g:tq_use_vim_autocompletefunc=1
<

g:tq_enabled_backends~
    this variable is offered by core query handler. It's a list of
    query_backends user want to enable, with the sequence of user prefered
    priority. Please be careful not to mis-spell when setting this variable.
    available options: `woxikon_de`, `jeck_ru`, `thesaurus_com`,
    `datamuse_com`, `mthesaur_txt`
    >
        let g:tq_enabled_backends = ["cilin_txt", \
                                     "woxikon_de", \
                                     "jeck_ru", \

<

g:tq_online_backends_timeout~
    Waiting time for online thesaurus backend before cancelled as timeout. >
        let g:tq_online_backends_timeout = 1.0
<

g/b:tq_language~
    Each query backend are associated with a Language: English (en), Chinese
    (cn), German (de), Russian(ru), etc.
    This variable decides of all backends enabled by
    `g:tq_enabled_backends`, which one to be used in general(g:)
    session or specific buffer(b:), based on the language they are associatd
    with. It can be either string or list. This setting can be eigher buffer
    variable or global variable. With buffer variable prioritized. Following
    are few examples:
        Only English Query Backends are to be used in general buffers:
            `let g:tq_language='en'
        All backends, regardless of their specific language, are to be used
            let g:tq_language='All'
        English and Chinese Query Backends are to be used in current buffer:
            let b:tq_language=['en', 'cn'] >
        let g:tq_language=['en']
<

g:tq_use_local_thesaurus_source_as_primary~
    DEPRECIATED!!! DO NOT USE THIS VARIABLE ANY MORE~
    This variable is used when initiating core query handler.  It determine
    the priority between online thesaurus backend(based on Thesaurus.com) and
    local thesaurus backend(based on mthesaur.txt). If
    value is
            0:      query with online backend first.
            1:      query with local backend first. >
        let g:tq_use_local_thesaurus_source_as_primary=0
<

g:tq_cilin_txt_file~
    this variable is offered by tq_cilin_txt_lookup. Used to determine locate
    `cilin.txt` file from your computer. If no `cilin.txt` is found at this
    location, location specified in &thesaurus will be checked. Default
    `cilin.txt` location would be "~/.vim/thesaurus/cilin.txt". Note that this
    plugin recognize only utf-8 decoding, hence only utf-8 encoding `cilin`
    will be correctly used. >
        let g:tq_cilin_txt_file="~/.vim/thesaurus/cilin.txt"
<

g:tq_openoffice_en_file~
    this variable is offered by openoffice_en_lookup. Used to determine
    locate OpenOffice thesaurus plugin's index and database file from your
    computer. If no database file is found from indicated location, this
    backend will report error. >
        let g:tq_openoffice_en_file="/usr/share/myspell/dicts/th_en_US_v2"
<

g:tq_mthesaur_file~
    this variable is offered by tq_local_mthesaur_lookup. Used to determine
    locate `mthesaur.txt` file from your computer. If no `mthesaur.txt` is
    found at this location, location specified in &thesaurus will be checked. >
        let g:tq_mthesaur_file="~/.vim/thesaurus/mthesaur.txt"
<

g:raise_backend_priority_if_synonym_found~
    this variable is offered by core query handler, if value is
          0:    priority of the backend that find the synonyms will be topped
          1:    backend priority won't be affected by synonym findings >
        let g:raise_backend_priority_if_synonym_found = 0
>

g:tq_truncation_on_relavance~
    This variable is for default query routine, if according to thesaurus.com,
    the found synonym's relavance is smaller or equal to this value, it is
    neglected
     Note that this truncation will truncate the wordlist for BOTH replacing
      candidate interface and thesaurus split won't be truncated. >
         let g:tq_truncation_on_relavance = 0
<

g:tq_truncation_on_definition_num~
    This variable is for replacing candidate display. If value is
        -1:     no truncate of output is made upon number of definitions.
        n:      only synonyms of the first n word definitions were retained.
    Note that this truncation will only affect the replacing candidate
    interface, thesaurus split will NOT be truncated. >
        let g:tq_truncation_on_definition_num = -1
<

g:tq_truncation_on_syno_list_size~
    This variable is for replacing candidate display. If value is
        -1:     no truncate of output is made upon number of synonyms from a
                single definition.
        n:      only first n synonyms of that definition will be retained.
    Note that this truncation will only affect the replacing candidate
    interface, thesaurus split will NOT be truncated. >
         let g:tq_truncation_on_syno_list_size = -1

4.2 Make Your Own Backend                                   *tq-backend-format*

Since v0.5.0, we have made backend importing dynamic. If none of the exising
backends suite your need, you can always make your own backend and put it in
folder `${Plugin_Root}/autoload/thesaurus_query/backends`. The backend is
written in Python. File name should always have `_lookup` in it. For example,
the backend I wrote for synonym query in thesaurus.com is
`thesaurus_com_lookup.py`. I shall call these files backend files

The backend file should follow the following format:
  - Each `_lookup.py` file must have variable `identifier`, `language` and
    function `query(target_word)` defined in it.
  - `identifier` defines the name of the backend, how it will be recognized by
    the plugin. Eg. `identifier=thesaurus_com_lookup`.
  - `language` defines the language of which the backend is supposed to query.
    Eg. if the plugin is supposed to query from English synonym sources, the
    file should have `language=en` in it.
    `query(target_word)` is supposed to query synonym for `target_word` and
    return synonym list in format as follows: >
    return [status, nested_list]
    # status:
    #     0:  normal,  result found, list will be returned as a nested list
    #     1:  normal, result not found, return empty list
    #     -1: unexpected result from query, return empty list
    # nested_list = [Classifier, list wordlist] # grouped synonym list with
    #                                           # description
    #     Classifier('str'): Description the current wordlist. Can be empty
    #                        string.
    #     wordlist = [word_0, word_1, ...]: list of words belonging to the
    #                                       group
<
After putting the backend file into
``${Plugin_Root}/autoload/thesaurus_query/backends`, it will be recognized the
next time the plugin is initiated. To use your plugin, add your backend's
`identifier` to Vim variable `g/b:tq_enabled_backends`, and activate the
language by adding its corresponding `language` to `g/b:tq_language`. Eg. to
enable `thesaurus_com_lookup.py` , we have >
    g:tq_enabled_backends = [ ..., 'thesaurus_com', ... ]
    g:tq_language = [..., 'en', ...]
set as default.
